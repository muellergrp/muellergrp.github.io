I previously taught the "evolutionary dynamics and molecular epidemiology of viruses" module at Summer Institute for Statistics and Modeling in Infectious Diseases ([SISMID](https://si.biostat.washington.edu/institutes/sismid)) together with [Julia Palacios](https://juliapalacios.github.io/) at Stanford University. We taught the module from 2020 on.
I also taugh phylodynamics at previous [Taming the BEAST](https://taming-the-beast.org/) workshops.
