I previously taught the "evolutionary dynamics and molecular epidemiology of viruses" module at Summer Institute for Statistics and Modeling in Infectious Diseases ([https://si.biostat.washington.edu/institutes/sismid](SISMID)) together with [https://juliapalacios.github.io/](Julia Palacios) at Stanford University. We taught the module from 2020 on.
I also taugh phylodynamics at previous [https://taming-the-beast.org/](Taming the BEAST) workshops.
