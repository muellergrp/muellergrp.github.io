The lab is planing on hiring two postdocs with a start date of April 1st at the earliest that will be advertised shortly.
Feel free to reach out if you are interested in working on viral or bacterial phylodynamics and in joining the lab at [nicola.mueller@muellerlab.io](mailto:nicola.mueller@muellerlab.io).

Both positions will be investigating the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases from pathogen genome data using phylodynamic methods. One of the positions will focus on developing methods for local-scale transmission dynamics from infectious diseases. 
The other position will be more flexible in scope, ranging from investigating recombination patterns in viruses using phylogenetic network approaches, or to study of bacterial transmission dynamics using phylodynamics. 

The exact projects will be tailored to the strengths and goals of the candidates when starting the positions. The lab will support and encourage the candidateâ€™s independent research and career interests that broadly align with the lab's interests and tailor the project accordingly. The candidate will be expected to participate in the center's meetings and seminar series, perform novel research, publish in peer-reviewed journals, and participate in national and/or international conferences.

Essential Skills
- PhD or equivalent in a relevant field when starting the position.
- Coding/scripting experience with high-level programming languages, such as Python, R, or Matlab.
- Familiarity with viral or bacterial infectious diseases.

Helpful Skills
- Background in basic biology, population genetics, or ecology.
- Experience in the analysis/modeling of infectious diseases.
- Strong statistical skills.
- Programming experience in Java.
- Experience handling viral or bacterial genome data.
- Prior experience in using phylogenetics and/or phylodynamics.
