The lab is planning to hire two postdocs with a start date of April 1st at the earliest, and these positions will be advertised shortly. Feel free to reach out if you are interested in working on viral or bacterial phylodynamics and in joining the lab at [nicola.mueller@muellerlab.io](mailto:nicola.mueller@muellerlab.io).

Both positions will involve investigating the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases from pathogen genome data using phylodynamic methods. One of the positions will focus on developing methods for local-scale transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. The other position will have a more flexible scope, ranging from investigating recombination patterns in viruses using phylogenetic network approaches to studying bacterial transmission dynamics using phylodynamics.

The exact projects will be tailored to the strengths and goals of the candidates upon starting the positions. The lab will support and encourage the candidatesâ€™ independent research and career interests that broadly align with the lab's focus, tailoring the project accordingly.

**Essential Skills:**
- PhD, or equivalent, in a relevant field upon starting the position.
- Coding/scripting experience with high-level programming languages such as Python, R, or Matlab.
- Familiarity with viral or bacterial infectious diseases.

**Helpful Skills:**
- Background in basic biology, population genetics, or ecology.
- Experience in the analysis/modeling of infectious diseases.
- Strong statistical skills.
- Programming experience in Java.
- Experience handling viral or bacterial genome data.
- Prior experience in using phylogenetics and/or phylodynamics.

More details will follow shortly.
