If you are interested in joining the lab for a PhD, postdoc, or research assistant position, please send a short email with your interests and your CV to <nicola.mueller@ucsf.edu>.

## Rotation Students

The lab is actively looking for rotation students who are interested in computational biology, phylodynamics, and infectious disease research. Rotation students will have the opportunity to work on exciting projects involving the analysis of pathogen transmission dynamics and evolution. If you are a graduate student at UCSF looking for a rotation, please reach out to discuss potential projects.

I'm mainly part of the [Biomedical Informatics (BMI) Program](https://bmi.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF. If you are interested in doing a PhD in the [EPPI Translational Science Program](https://eppicenter.ucsf.edu/education/translational-science-program), please reach out.

## Postdoctoral Position

The Mueller lab at UCSF is seeking a postdoctoral research fellow in phylodynamics to develop novel MCMC inference approaches for studying infectious disease transmission dynamics from pathogen genome data. The position is fully funded and offers opportunities for close mentorship within the multidisciplinary EPPIcenter research environment.
