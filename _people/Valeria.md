<h3>Bio</h3>

I'm a doctoral student in the Biological and Medical Informatics program at UCSF, currently rotating with Nicola Müller’s group at the Experimental and Population-based Pathogen Investigation Center (EPPIcenter). My research focuses on the outbreak dynamics of E. coli, with a particular interest in quantifying the plasticity of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes and understanding household transmission patterns.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Biology and my Master's in Computational Biology and Biostatistics from St. John's University. During my training, I contributed to a range of interdisciplinary projects integrating experimental and computational approaches, centering on how microbes interact with their environments and affect human health. At my home institution, I worked in Dr. Javier Fernandez Juarez's lab, developing whole-cell biosensors for detecting disease biomarkers. I also served as a research assistant in Dr. Tal Korem's lab at Columbia University, where I applied bioinformatic and statistical tools to investigate the relationship between vaginal microbial composition and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

These experiences have shaped my broader interest in microbial dynamics, at both the molecular and population level, and how we can harness bioinformatics to advance public health, especially in settings impacted by social and structural inequalities.
