 I am an incoming Assistant Profesor at UCSF and the EPPIcenter. My research develops and applies tools to study the evolutionary and transmission dynamics of infectious diseases from genomic sequence data, with the ultimate goal of informing effective population health interventions. My work has spanned multiple infectious diseases, particularly influenza and coronaviruses, as well as some work on Ebola viruses. My research often includes the development of novel computational tools that are motivated by questions that could not be answered previously from genomic data. For example, I developed a phylodynamic approach to quantify boundary-driven growth dynamics of solid tumors from genome sequences (Lewinsohn et al., Nat Eco Evo, 2023). More recently, I became excited about studying the transmission dynamics of bacterial pathogens, which presents both a massive challenge to public health due to antimicrobial resistance and the development of computational tools due to the complex evolutionary pathways bacteria can undergo.
