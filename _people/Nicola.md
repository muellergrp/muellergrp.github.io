<h3>Bio</h3>

I did my Bachelor and Master in Biotechnology at ETH Z端rich in Switzerland.
For my Master thesis, I joined the group of [Prof. Tanja Stadler](https://www.bsse.ethz.ch/cevo/) at ETH Z端rich.
During that time, I became interested in the evolution and transmission of infectious diseases and phylodynamics, i.e. the study of transmission dynamics from phylogenetic trees.
After finishing my MSc, I stayed on for my PhD in the same group, developing Bayesian phylodynamics appraoches to study the evolution and transmission of infectious diseases.
My main work was concerned with using pathogen genomes to learn about how infectious disease spread between different regions and different host species.
I further developed Bayesian phylogenetic methods to reconstruct how influenza viruses reshuffeled their genome segments, a process called reassortment in the past and studied the local transmission dynamics of influenza viruses in Basel, Switzerland.

After completing my PhD at ETH Z端rich, I joined the group of [Prof. Trevor Bedford](https://bedford.io/) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, WA, USA as a Swiss National Science Foundation Postdoc Mobility Fellow. During that time, I worked on using genomic data to study the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Washington State and developped approaches to reconstruct recombination patterns.
