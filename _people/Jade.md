<h3>Bio</h3>
I am a third year student at UC Berkeley pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Molecular Environmental Biology with a minor in Public Health. I am interested in pathogen genomics, systems biology, and host-pathogen interactions. At the Müller Lab, I am assisting in applying phylodynamic analyses to a wide array of scenarios and pathogens, primarily through multi-type birth-death simulations. At UC Berkeley, I am heavily involved in environmentalism and student research initiatives on campus. I hope to build a career focused on examining the impact that a changing climate has on the transmission of pathogens, and I’m passionate about using scientific research to inform and advocate for public policy implementation.
