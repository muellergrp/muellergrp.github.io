<h3>Bio</h3>

I am a first-year Biophysics PhD student at UCSF and currently a rotation student in Nicola Müller’s group at the Experimental and Population-based Pathogen Investigation Center (EPPIcenter). During my rotation, I will investigate how recombination events in SARS-CoV-2 relate to disease prevalence.

Before starting my journey as a PhD student at UCSF, I earned a Bachelor's degree in Biology from ETH Zurich. During my undergraduate studies, I was a visiting student in the Physical Virology group led by Profs. Gelbart and Knobler at the University of California, Los Angeles. After completing my Bachelor's degree, I briefly interned in the Caflisch group at the University of Zurich, where I gained experience in computational structural biology. This was followed by an internship in the vaccine development group at Bavarian Nordic, a vaccine company, at their Munich location. (edited)
